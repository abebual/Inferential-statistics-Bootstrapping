# Inferential-statistics-Bootstrapping
In this mini-project, you'll use medical charge data to make inferences about the population using bootstrapping (ie. simulating repeated re-runs of an experiment.). Bootstrapping is about using computing power to essentially re-run the sample draw again and again and again to see what actually happens.
